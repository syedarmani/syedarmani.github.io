I am currently enrolled in Master of Finance course at Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. 
I did my bachelors in Computer Science and then worked for more than 5 years in consulting. 

Enjoy road trips, poker, reading non fiction books, generating music with python and attending food festivals. I am extremely curious about macroeconomics 
and patterns in financial data. This is my personal blog where i mostly write about **Finance** and **AI**.
